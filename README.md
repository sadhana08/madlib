This is my first try of doing simple games in python and exploring that in github so that i can learn both simultaneously.
Iam watching free code camp youtube for this and trying to learn on my own practically here.
This one is a simple game called madlib where the player is asked to tell few words and finally read to them loud on how it gets filled in the sentence.
This contains mainly formatting strings.
